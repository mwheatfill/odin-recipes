The Odin Project Foundations Course HTML Recipes Project

## About this project

This project is the first of many projects in The Odin Project full stack development course. This project demonstrates my knowledge of basic HTML including boilerplate, tags both nested and siblings, along with creating absolute/relative links and including images within HTML. Because it does not include an CSS, it will not be pretty.
